## Shell Scripting in DevOps.
- **`Shell scripting`** is the process of creating computer programs or scripts that are interpreted by a `Unix` or `Linux shell`, such as **`bash`** or **`sh`**.
- It involves writing commands and instructions in a text file that can be executed by the shell to perform various tasks, such as **automating repetitive tasks**, **manipulating files** and **directories**, and **running system commands**.

## What is `#!/bin/bash?` can we write `#!/bin/sh` as well?

- In practice, **#!/bin/bash** is often used because it provides more advanced features and is more widely available on modern systems. However, if you want your script to be more portable and compatible with a wider range of Unix or Linux systems, you might consider using **#!/bin/sh**.



## Write a Shell Script which prints `I will complete #90DaysofDevOps challenge`

- file creation and providing permission of read, write and execution.

- Writing file with extension of `.sh` and running on terminal.

## Was it difficult?

- I think `Shell Scripting` is not difficult because its basically any other porgramming language we use which have proper syntax with header files to include and many more.
- Shell scripting involves writing scripts in a Unix shell language, such as Bash, that can automate tasks, process data, and perform system operations. The syntax of shell scripting can be simple, but it can also become complex as you work with more advanced features and commands.
